This page contains some simple ciphers. This was going to be extended to include some more sophisticated ciphers, but I didn't have the time or incentive to develop this page further.

<h3>Overview</h3>

At the moment the page currently supports two simple cipher:
<ul>
  <li>rot-13: A cipher where each character is shifted by 13 places along the alphabet</li>
  <li>Holly: A cipher developed by a friend as a child.  This page was made to crack that cipher for fun.</il>
</ul>
